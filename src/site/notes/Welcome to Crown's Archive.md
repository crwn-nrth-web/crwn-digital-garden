Hello! You can call me Crown. I’m a third-year Physics & Astronomy student at the University of Waterloo, with a minor in Philosophy. This site is my digital garden — though I like to think of it as my **digital archive**. It’s where I share notes, reflections, and half-formed ideas I’ve collected over the years. Nothing here is set in stone; these are working notes, open to revision and expansion.

I’ve been keeping a private Zettelkasten in Obsidian for over three years now, and it’s become something like a second brain. Recently, I’ve been wanting to share some of what I’ve collected — not as a polished blog, but in a more open-ended, exploratory way. That’s when I found digital gardens. Andy Matuschak calls it _“working with the back door open,”_ and to me it feels like a Zettelkasten made public. So bear with me as I start translating my private notes into this archive.

Like any archive, this space is organized into collections, such as:

- **Physics & Astronomy** — coursework notes, research curiosities
- **Philosophy** — metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind
- **History & Classics** — Greek antiquity, thoughts on epic poems like Homer's

This archive is about exploring ideas as they grow. New entries will be catalogued, and older ones might get revised, linked, or expanded. Think of it as browsing the stacks with me: you might find a half-finished note, a messy margin, or a fully developed thought.

## Disclaimer 
This is very much a work in progress; in fact, no matter how much I add to this diital archive, it will never be complete. Most of these notes are collections of thoughts from what I've read, heard, and learnt throughout my undergrad. I am no way close to being an expert on anything I'm writing about it. I am simply a fledging academic that hopes to find a community. Thus, if you see any mistakes here, don't hesitate to point them out. Though, in all honesty, you will see typos and grammatial errors, and all I can say abot that is: whoops. 

 I want to share what I know, collaborate, and learn. However, don't take credit for what I have here, or distribute what I make without attribution. Therefore the following license applies to everything I write and all figures and drawings that I make myself or in collaboration with anyone else:
